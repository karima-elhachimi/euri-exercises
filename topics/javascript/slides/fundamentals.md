### When it all started

- 1995: [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) joined Netscape, initially to add 'Scheme' language to the browser.
- 1995: Sun puts pressure on Netscape to add Java to the browser.
  - To complex, not for amateur programmer
  - Brendan helps Netscape decide
  - Brendan starts a new language
    - In 10 days! (Code Name: Mocha)

### Ecmascript

- 1995 (sept): Mocha was renamed to LiveScript
- 1995 (dec): LiveScript was later renamed to JavaScript
- 1996: People start using Javascript
- 1996: Microsoft is coming with IE. Netscape in problem.
- 1997: Netscape reaches out to Ecma. JS was standardized: Ecmascript

  - Renamed ES6 to ES2015
  - Browser starting the implementation of ES2015

- Browsers are implementing ES2019 and beyond

### TC39

The Ecma TC39 committee is responsible for evolving the ECMAScript programming language and authoring the specification. The committee operates by consensus and has discretion to alter the specification as it sees fit.

#### The TC39 Process

- Stage 0: Initial input
- Stage 1: Proposal (spec, polyfill, demo)
- Stage 2: Draft (ready for testing)
- Stage 3: Candidate (almost there, last bits)
- Stage 4: Finished (ready)
