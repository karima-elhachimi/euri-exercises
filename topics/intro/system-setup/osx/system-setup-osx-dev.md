## Setup OSX for Development

A fresh OSX isn't entirely ready for modern development, but all the tools you need are available. A good terminal, popular bash tools, Git, a decent package manager - when properly setup, modern development on OSX can be a lot of fun. In particular, this document outlines how to configure your OSX in such a way that it can easily handle most development tasks.

## Language Setup

System Preferences - Language & Region - Preferred language
Set to English (if not already)

## XCode

A must have for any Mac development, even for just the command line tools

- Install xcode from [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

- Install command line utilities

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- Accept the license agreement

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

The missing package manager for macOS (or Linux)

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install bash completion

```bash
brew install bash-completion
```

After the installation completes verify your ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile

### ~./bashrc

```bash
vi ~/.bashrc

## content
[ -n "$PS1" ] && source ~/.bash_profile;

## i = insert, esc :wq to save
```

### ~./bash_profile

```bash
vi ~/.bash_profile

## content
# Add tab completion for many Bash commands
if which brew &> /dev/null && [ -f "$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion" ]; then
	source "$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion";
elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
	source /etc/bash_completion;
fi;
```

### Sample commands

    brew cleanup       -- uninstall unused and old versions of packages
    brew commands      -- show a list of commands
    brew config        -- show homebrew and system configuration
    brew doctor        -- audits your installation for common issues
    brew info          -- information about a formula
    brew install       -- install a formula
    brew list          -- list files in a formula or not-installed formulae
    brew outdated      -- list formulae for which a newer version is available
    brew pin           -- pin specified formulae
    brew reinstall     -- install a formula anew; re-using its current options
    brew search        -- search for a formula or cask (/regex/ or string)
    brew tap           -- tap a new formula repository from GitHub, or list existing taps
    brew uninstall     -- uninstall a formula
    brew unpin         -- unpin specified formulae
    brew untap         -- remove a tapped repository
    brew update        -- fetch latest version of Homebrew and all formulae
    brew upgrade       -- upgrade outdated formulae

### Cask

Cask is a Homebrew plugin that allow to install OSX applications distributed as binaries. Usually you get a dmg file and then drag-n-drop into /Applications - with Cask this process can be automated using the command line.

```bash
brew tap caskroom/cask
```

```bash
# Just hold the âŒ˜-Key a bit longer to get a list of all active short cuts of the current application.
brew cask install cheatsheet

# A Quick Look plugin for source code with syntax highlighting
brew cask install qlcolorcode

# A Quick Look plugin for Markdown files
brew cask install qlmarkdown

# A Quick Look plugin for json files
brew cask install quicklook-json

# A window manager
brew cask install spectacle

# A clipboard manager tool (so you can stop saying damnit when you pressed the keys for copy instead of paste)
brew cask install flycut

```

### Brew Cask update

brew-cask-upgrade is a command-line tool for upgrading every outdated app installed by Homebrew Cask.

Homebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications and large binaries alike.

brew-cask-upgrade is an external command to replace the native upgrade by offering interactivity, an improved interface, and higher granularity of what to upgrade.

```bash
brew tap buo/cask-upgrade
```

```bash
# Update outdated casks
brew cu
```

## NodeJS

A bunch of tools are powered by Node and installed via npm. This applies to you even if you don't care about Node development. If you want to install tools for modern web application development you will need this.

Although you could install NodeJS directly following the steps outlined on the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) site, we suggest you to use a version manager for Node.

For MacOs the following version managers exist:

- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

I prefer nvm instead of n because of the global package isolation, but some people tend to disagree ;), so from here on we will follow this path

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

After the installation completes verify your ~/.bash_profile

### ~./bash_profile

```bash
vi ~/.bash_profile

## content
# Add tab completion for many Bash commands
if which brew &> /dev/null && [ -f "$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion" ]; then
	source "$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion";
elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
	source /etc/bash_completion;
fi;

# Necessary for nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

### Verify installation

```bash
command -v nvm
# this should print nvm
```

### Install latest lts

```bash
nvm install lts/dubnium
```

### Sample commands

    --version           -- print out the latest released version of nvm
    alias               -- show or set aliases
    current             -- list installed versions
    deactivate          -- undo effects of `nvm` on current shell
    exec                -- run <command> on <version>. Uses .nvmrc if available
    help                -- show help
    install             -- download and install a version in <node|iojs|node version number>
    ls                  -- list installed versions or versions matching a given description
    ls-remote           -- list remote versions available for install
    reinstall-packages  -- reinstall global `npm` packages contained in <version> to current version
    run                 -- run `node` on <version> with <args> as arguments. Uses .nvmrc if available
    unalias             -- deletes an alias
    uninstall           -- uninstall a version
    unload              -- unload `nvm` from shell
    use                 -- modify PATH to use <version>. Uses .nvmrc if available
    version             -- resolve the given description to a single local version
    version-remote      -- resolve the given description to a single remote version
    which               -- display path to installed node version. Uses .nvmrc if available

## Terminal

MacOs already has a pretty decent terminal built-in but if you want to use an alternative try ITerm2

    brew cask install iterm2

## Version Control: Git

Obviously. If you want Git to be able to save credentials (so you don't have to enter SSH keys / passwords every single time you do anything), also setup the Git Credential helper.

```bash
# install
brew install git

# configure credential manager
git config --global credential.helper cache

# configure user name
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"

# configure commit email
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

### Sample commands

    add             -- add file contents to the index
    branch          -- list, create, or delete branches
    checkout        -- checkout a branch or paths to the working tree
    clone           -- clone a repository into a new directory
    commit          -- record changes to the repository
    diff            -- show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
    fetch           -- download objects and refs from another repository
    init            -- create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
    log             -- show commit logs
    merge           -- join two or more development histories together
    mv              -- move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
    pull            -- fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
    push            -- update remote refs along with associated objects
    rebase          -- forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
    reset           -- reset current HEAD to the specified state
    rm              -- remove files from the working tree and from the index
    show            -- show various types of objects
    status          -- show the working tree status
    tag             -- create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

### Diff/Merge tool

I personally recommend [p4merge](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/visual-merge-tool) as merge tool, but you could also use BeyondCompare see below for more info

```bash
# ~/.gitconfig
[merge]
	tool = p4merge
[mergetool "p4merge"]
  	keepTemporaries = false
	prompt = false
	trustExitCode = false
```

### GUI

If the git command line gets too complicated you can install the following tools

- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

## Code Editor: VS Code

The best editor for (Javascript) development: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Although there is a cask for visual studio code, i recommend against it. As all autoupdating apps should never be installed using brew, as they would be outdated.

To make it even better install the following extenstions

- EditorConfig for VS Code
- ESLint
- Path Intellisense
- Spelling and Grammer Checker
