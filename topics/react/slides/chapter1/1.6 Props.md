# Props
## Receiving state from parent component
Another way to get application data into a component is by Props.

Props is the data which is passed to the child component from the parent component. This allows for our React architecture to stay pretty straight forward. Handle state in the highest most parent component which needs to use the specific data, and if you have a child component that also needs that data, pass that data down as props.

Here’s a very basic example of using props:
```
    // App.js
    function App() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <HelloWorld name="euricom"/>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // HelloWorld.js
    class HelloWorld extends React.Component{
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
                </div>
            )
        }
    };
```

Notice in our app.js we have added an attribute called name with a value of "Euricom". Now in our component, we can use {this.props.name} to get "Euricom".

Another way to pass props is by transclusion, or in other words, as element content:
```
    // App.js
    function App() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <HelloWorld>Euricom</HelloWorld>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // HelloWorld.js
    class HelloWorld extends React.Component{
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Hello {this.props.children}</h1>
                </div>
            )
        }
    };
```

We get a hold of the parent his content by *this.props.children*.

Let’s look at a more advanced example. We’re going to have two components now. One parent, one child. The parent is going to keep track of the state and pass a part of that state down to the child as props.

Let’s first take a look at that parent component:
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import EmployeeList from './EmployeeList';

class EmployeeContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      company: 'Euricom',
      employees: ['Peter', 'Niels', 'Kevin']
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { company, employees } = this.state;
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <h1>{company}</h1>
        <EmployeeList employees={employees} />
      </Fragment>
    )
  }
}

export default EmployeeContainer;
```
There really isn’t much going on in this component that we haven’t seen before. We have an initial state and we pass part of that initial state to another component.

The majority of the new code will come from this child component so let’s take a closer look at that:
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

export default class EmployeeList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <h3>Employees</h3>
        <ul>
          {this.props.employees.map((employee) => <li>{employee}</li>)}
        </ul>
      </Fragment>
    )
  }
}
```
In our child component we want to print out the list of employees which we passed down from our parent component.

We want to print these out as an unordered list (ul) so we need to convert the array of strings to an array of list items (li). For this process we are going to create a function (renderItems) which will handle this for us.

If you’re not familiar with Array.prototype.map, this code might look a little weird. All map does is it creates a new array, calls our callback function on each item in the array, and fills the new array with the result of calling the callback function on each item.

In this case we will loop over every string in our array and transform them to list items.

The result of our map function will return the following:

    ["<li>Peter</li>", "<li>Niels</li>", "<li>Kevin</li>"];

Finally we call our renderItems function in our render (by surrounding it with { }) to fill our < ul > with the list items.

### Key
When we take a look at our console, we notice this warning:

    Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of EmployeeList. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.

The warning gives us a good description on why it's being thrown. When rendering items from an array we should add a (unique - inside the rendered collection) key attribute.

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```
The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
```
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```
When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:
```
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```
We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.

    {this.props.employees.map((employee, index) => <li key={`${index}_${employee}`}>{employee}</li>)}

## Stateless functional components
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.

### State

Because a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function, you cannot use setState() in your component. That’s the reason why they also get called functional stateless components. So everytime you see a functional component you can be sure that this particular component doesn’t have its own state.

### Benefits
* Functional component are much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks
* You end up with less code
* They help you to use best practices. It will get easier to separate container and presentational components because you need to think more about your component’s state if you don’t have access to setState() in your component
* The React team mentioned that there may be a performance boost for functional component in future React versions

**If you need a state in your component you will either need to create a class component or you lift the state up to the parent component and pass it down the functional component via props.**

Since we don't have state in our EmployeeList we could refactor it to a functional component:
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

const EmployeeList = (props) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3>Employees</h3>
      <ul>
        {props.employees.map((employee, index) => <li key={`${index}_${employee}`}>{employee}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </Fragment>
  )
}
export default EmployeeList;
```

## Receiving functionality from parent component
It’s important to understand that wherever the data lives, is the exact place you want to manipulate that data. This keeps it simple to reason about your data. All getter/setter methods for a certain piece of data will always be in the same component where that data was defined.

If you needed to manipulate some piece of data outside where the data lives, you’d pass the getter/setter method into that component as props. Let’s take a look at an example like that.

We're going to add a new component (AddNewEmployee) to our previous example. We'll render an input box and a button so we can add a new employee to our list.
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

const AddEmployee = ({ newEmployee, onHandleChangeEmployee, addNewEmployee }) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <div>Add new employee</div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={newEmployee}
        onChange={(e) => onHandleChangeEmployee(e)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => addNewEmployee()}>add new</button>
    </Fragment>
  )
}
export default AddEmployee;
```

If we take a look at our new component, we can see that it doesn't do much besides rendering some HTML.

All the logic is being passed by our parent (EmployeeContainer) component. Since our parent holds our state, we'll also put all the logic that can manipulate our state there.

Our updated parent component (EmployeeContainer):
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import EmployeeList from './EmployeeList';
import AddEmployee from './AddEmployee';

class EmployeeContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      company: 'Euricom',
      employees: ['Peter', 'Niels', 'Kevin', 'Peter'],
      newEmployee: '',
    }
  }

  _onHandleChangeEmployee(e) {
    this.setState({
      newEmployee: e.target.value
    })
  }

  _addNewEmployee() {
    const { employees, newEmployee } = this.state;
    this.setState({
      employees: employees.concat(newEmployee),
      newEmployee: ''
    })
  }

  render() {
    const { company, employees, newEmployee } = this.state;
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <h1>{company}</h1>
        <AddEmployee
          newEmployee={newEmployee}
          onHandleChangeEmployee={(e) => this._onHandleChangeEmployee(e)}
          addNewEmployee={(newEmployee) => this._addNewEmployee(newEmployee)}
        />
        <EmployeeList employees={employees} />
      </Fragment>
    )
  }
}

export default EmployeeContainer;
```

In the example above we've added our AddEmployee component in our render function. We pass in 3 arguments:

- **newEmployee**: a state variable which will be used as a value for our input box
- **onChange**: a function (_changeHandler) which will be used to respond on every value change in our input box. Everytime the value changes, we update the newEmployee variable (on our state).
- **addNewEmployee**: a function which will add the new employee to the list of employees on our state. We also empty our newEmployee for new input.

#### Extra example
As an extra example we could have our employees be objects and add an 'isAvailable' property.

    // employeeContainer.js
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            company: 'Euricom',
            employees: [
                {name: 'Peter', isAvailable: true},
                {name: 'Niels', isAvailable: false},
                {name: 'Kevin', isAvailable: true}
            ],
            newEmployee: ''
        }
    }

Now in our employeeList we could give our employees a color which relates to his availability:
```
const EmployeeList = (props) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3>Employees</h3>
      <ul>
        {props.employees.map((employee, index) => (
          <li key={`${index}_${employee.name}`}>
            <p style={{ 'color': employee.isAvailable ? 'green' : 'red' }}>{employee.name}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

Additionally we want to change the availability when clicking on an employee. For this to happen we create an extra function on our employeeContainer:
```
// employeeContainer.js
_toggleAvailability(emp) {
    this.setState({
        employees: this.state.employees.map(employee => {
            if (employee.name === emp.name) {
                employee.isAvailable = !employee.isAvailable;
            }
            return employee;
        })
    })
}
```
Next we'll pass this function as a prop to our employeeList:
```
  render() {
    const { company, employees, newEmployee } = this.state;
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <h1>{company}</h1>
        <AddEmployee
          newEmployee={newEmployee}
          onHandleChangeEmployee={(e) => this._onHandleChangeEmployee(e)}
          addNewEmployee={(newEmployee) => this._addNewEmployee(newEmployee)}
        />
        <EmployeeList employees={employees} toggleAvailability={(employee) => this._toggleAvailability(employee)}/>
      </Fragment>
    )
  }
```

Finally we make use of the passed in function in our employeeList:
```
const EmployeeList = ({ employees, toggleAvailability}) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3>Employees</h3>
      <ul>
        {employees.map((employee, index) => (
          <li key={`${index}_${employee.name}`} onClick={() => toggleAvailability(employee)}>
            <p style={{ 'color': employee.isAvailable ? 'green' : 'red', 'cursor': 'pointer'}}>{employee.name}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```
When testing our app we notice that we can effectively change the availability of our employees but when adding a new one there seems to be something wrong. We are adding a string into our array of employees when actually we need to provide an object:
```
  _addNewEmployee() {
    const { employees, newEmployee } = this.state;
    this.setState({
      employees: employees.concat({ name: newEmployee, isAvailable: true }),
      newEmployee: ''
    })
  }
```

## Proptypes
As your app grows it's helpful to ensure that your components are used correctly. We do this by allowing you to specify propTypes. React.PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid. When an invalid value is provided for a prop, a warning will be shown in the console.

propTypes allow you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component. With propTypes you can specify that certain props are required or that certain props be a specific type.
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const AddEmployee = ({ newEmployee, onHandleChangeEmployee, addNewEmployee }) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <div>Add new employee</div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={newEmployee}
        onChange={(e) => onHandleChangeEmployee(e)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => addNewEmployee()}>add new</button>
    </Fragment>
  )
}

AddEmployee.propTypes = {
  newEmployee: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onHandleChangeEmployee: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  addNewEmployee: PropTypes.func.isRequired
}

export default AddEmployee;
```

In the example above we define all our props with their type. Notice we can specify if a prop is required or not. If a required prop is not passed by it's parent or if it's not a function a warning will be thrown:
```
Warning: Failed propType: Required prop `addNew` was not specified in `AddEmployee`. Check the render method of `EmployeeContainer`.
```
But even if a prop is not required, a warning will always be thrown if the expected prop has a different type than defined:
```
Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `newEmployee` of type `string` supplied to `AddEmployee`, expected `number`.
```
It's recommended to always specify propTypes. It gives developers a quick overview of all used props and if they are required or not.

An overview of all propTypes can be found on the react website: https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html

## getDefaultProps
Allows you to specify a default (or a backup) value for certain props just in case those props are never passed into the component.
```
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const EmployeeList = ({ employees, toggleAvailability}) => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h3>Employees</h3>
      <ul>
        {employees.map((employee, index) => (
          <li key={`${index}_${employee.name}`} onClick={() => toggleAvailability(employee)}>
            <p style={{ 'color': employee.isAvailable ? 'green' : 'red', 'cursor': 'pointer'}}>{employee.name}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Fragment>
  )
}

EmployeeList.propTypes = {
  employees: PropTypes.array
}

EmployeeList.defaultProps = {
  employees: [{ name: 'Wart Claes', isAvailable: true }]
};

export default EmployeeList;
```
