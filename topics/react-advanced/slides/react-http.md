## Introduction

As React does not have a build-in service/library for doing rest based http class we have to rely on 3th party libraries.

- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) (standardized, rising)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (popular)
- [SuperAgent](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/)

> We'll zoom in on axios as it provides the best out-of-the-box experience
